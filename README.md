# Looking Glass

Custom, dynamic multiviews for OBS Studio.

OBS ships with a single fixed multiview layout. Looking Glass lets you build as many
multiview windows as you like, each with its own grid, its own mix of content, and its
own per-cell labels — then open them on any monitor, in a window or fullscreen. Layouts
are saved per scene collection and restored automatically, and every window can be
driven remotely over obs-websocket.

## Features

* **Any number of multiviews.** Create, duplicate, rename, and delete as many layouts as you need.
* **Freeform grids.** 1–16 rows by 1–16 columns, with cells merged into arbitrary rectangular spans.
* **Mixed content per cell.** Program, studio-mode preview, any scene, any video source, a named canvas, or a placeholder.
* **Fully styled labels.** Per-cell text, font, size, background color and opacity, and nine-way alignment — rendered inside the OBS graphics pipeline, so they scale with the cell.
* **Broadcast safe areas.** Optional EBU R 95 overlays (action safe, title safe, 4:3 inner safe, and a center crosshair) per cell.
* **On-air tally.** Optional status border on scene cells: red for Program, green for Preview in studio mode.
* **Reusable templates.** Save any layout as a template shared across scene collections, with or without its exact source and scene names.
* **Per-monitor window control.** Windowed, fullscreen on a specific monitor, or centered on the main display.
* **State that sticks.** Geometry, monitor, fullscreen state, and which windows were open persist across scene collection switches and OBS restarts.
* **obs-websocket control.** Open, close, and send multiviews to the main display from outside OBS.

## Requirements

OBS Studio 31.1 or later. (Looking Glass uses the canvas API introduced in that release.)

## Getting Started

Everything lives under **Tools ▸ Looking Glass**.

1. Choose **Create New Multiview…**
2. Give it a name. The grid starts from the built-in default template: a 2x2 Preview,
   a 2x2 Program, and the bottom two rows auto-filled with the scenes in your current
   collection.
3. Adjust the grid, set widgets on the cells you care about, and click **OK**. The new
   multiview opens immediately.

### The Grid Editor

The left pane is a live map of the layout. The right pane holds the grid settings and
the cell actions.

| Action | How |
|---|---|
| Select a cell | Click it |
| Select a range | Click and drag across the grid |
| Add to / toggle a selection | Ctrl+click, or Ctrl+drag |
| Assign content | Select one cell, then **Set Widget** |
| Change content | Select the cell, then **Edit Widget** |
| Combine cells | Select a full rectangle, then **Merge Widgets** |
| Break cells apart / clear them | Select them, then **Reset Widgets** |

Merging requires the selection to form a complete rectangle, and any already-merged cell
it touches must be fully inside the selection — partial overlaps are rejected. Resetting
splits merged cells back into empty 1x1 cells.

**Rows** and **Columns** resize the grid in place. Cells that still fit are kept (with
their spans clamped to the new bounds); anything outside the new bounds is dropped and
replaced with empty cells. **Border Width** (1–10 px) and **Line Color** control the grid
lines drawn between cells.

### Widget Types

Each cell is assigned one widget type from the **Set Widget** dialog:

| Type | Shows |
|---|---|
| `None` | Nothing — an empty cell |
| `Preview` | The studio-mode preview scene, falling back to the program output when studio mode is off |
| `Program` | The main program output |
| `Canvas` | The main canvas, or a specific named canvas |
| `Scene` | A specific scene |
| `Source` | A specific video source |
| `Placeholder` | The Looking Glass icon, as a visual spacer |

Content is scaled to fit its cell with the aspect ratio preserved and centered, so mixed
cell shapes never distort the picture.

Two per-cell toggles sit alongside the type:

* **Draw Safe Areas** overlays broadcast safe regions on the cell content — action safe, title safe, 4:3 inner safe, and a center crosshair.
* **Show Status Border** draws a colored border reflecting live status: red when the scene is on air in Program, green when it is in Preview in studio mode, nothing otherwise. Offered on `Scene` cells.

### Labels

Every cell has its own label settings:

* **Show Label** toggles it entirely.
* **Custom Text** overrides the label; leave it empty to use the source or scene name automatically.
* **Font** picks family, style, and point size. Labels are drawn as OBS overlays, so the size scales with the cell rather than staying fixed in screen pixels.
* **Background** sets the label backing color, including opacity — the picker shows the resulting hex value and opacity percentage.
* **Vertical** and **Horizontal** place the label in any of nine positions within the cell.

## Managing Multiviews

**Tools ▸ Looking Glass ▸ Manage Multiviews…** lists every multiview in the current scene
collection:

* **Show Multiview** — open it, or focus it if it is already open
* **Edit Multiview** — reopen the grid editor; open windows reload live
* **Rename** / **Delete** / **Duplicate**
* **Create Template** — save this layout as a reusable template

## Templates

Templates are layouts without window state, shared across *all* scene collections.

Creating one from **Manage Multiviews ▸ Create Template** offers a **Preserve exact source
and scene names** checkbox:

* **Checked** — the template keeps the exact widget types and source/scene names from the multiview. Best for reproducing a layout inside one collection.
* **Unchecked** — content cells become placeholders. Best for a structural layout you will reuse against different scenes.

Apply a template from the **Template** dropdown in the multiview editor. Applying replaces
the current grid, so you are asked to confirm first.

**Tools ▸ Looking Glass ▸ Manage Templates…** renames, edits, and deletes your templates.
The built-in **Default (OBS-style)** template is always present and cannot be modified —
it is regenerated on each launch so its auto-filled scene cells match your current
collection.

## Window Controls

Each multiview gets its own submenu under **Tools ▸ Looking Glass**:

| Entry | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Open** | Opens the window, or focuses it if already open |
| **Close** | Closes the window (enabled only while it is open) |
| **Edit…** | Opens the grid editor for this layout |
| **Send to Main Display** | Opens if needed, then centers it as a 1280x720 window on the primary display |
| **Fullscreen on \<monitor\>** | Opens if needed, then goes fullscreen on that monitor |
| **Windowed** | Leaves fullscreen and restores the last windowed geometry |

Right-clicking inside a multiview window offers the same per-monitor fullscreen options,
plus **Edit Multiview…** and **Close Multiview**. **Windowed** appears there only while the
window is fullscreen.

Window state is saved as you move and resize. When you switch scene collections or restart
OBS, the multiviews that were open reopen where you left them, on the monitor they were on,
fullscreen if they were fullscreen.

## Controlling Multiviews from obs-websocket

Looking Glass registers an obs-websocket vendor named `looking-glass`, so multiview
windows can be opened, closed, and sent to the main display from outside OBS Studio
(Stream Deck, Companion, custom tooling) — the same actions offered by the
`Tools ▸ Looking Glass ▸ <multiview name>` submenus.

| Request type | Description |
|---|---|
| `OpenMultiview` | Opens the multiview window, or focuses it if it is already open. |
| `CloseMultiview` | Closes the multiview window. Succeeds as a no-op when it is not open. |
| `SendMultiviewToMainDisplay` | Opens the multiview if needed, then centers it as a 1280x720 window on the primary display. |

Call them with obs-websocket's `CallVendorRequest` request. Every request takes a single
field, `multiviewName`, naming a multiview in the current scene collection:

```json
{
  "requestType": "CallVendorRequest",
  "requestData": {
    "vendorName": "looking-glass",
    "requestType": "OpenMultiview",
    "requestData": {
      "multiviewName": "Studio Wall"
    }
  }
}
```

The vendor response data carries a `success` boolean, plus an `error` string describing
the problem when `success` is `false`:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "No multiview named 'Studio Wall' exists in the current scene collection."
}
```

Requests are registered once obs-websocket has loaded. If obs-websocket is not available,
Looking Glass logs a note and everything else works as normal.

## Where Settings Are Stored

Multiview layouts are stored per scene collection; templates are global.

| Platform | Path |
|---|---|
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\obs-studio\plugin_config\looking-glass\` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/obs-studio/plugin_config/looking-glass/` |
| Linux | `~/.config/obs-studio/plugin_config/looking-glass/` |

Inside that directory, `multiviews/<Scene Collection>.json` holds the layouts for one
collection, and `templates.json` holds your templates.

## Building

Looking Glass is built with the [OBS plugin template](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-plugintemplate)
build system. `buildspec.json` pins the OBS, Qt, and prebuilt dependency versions used for
release builds.

### Supported Build Environments

| Platform  | Tool   |
|-----------|--------|
| Windows   | Visual Studio 17 2022 |
| macOS     | XCode 16.0 |
| Windows, macOS  | CMake 3.30.5 |
| Ubuntu 24.04 | CMake 3.28.3 |

### Project Layout

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `src/core/` | Layout data model and per-collection/template persistence |
| `src/ui/` | Tools menu, grid editor, dialogs, and the multiview window |
| `src/render/` | Per-cell OBS display rendering, labels, safe areas, status borders |
| `src/api/` | obs-websocket vendor requests |
| `deps/` | Vendored third-party headers (`obs-websocket-api.h`) |
| `data/locale/` | Translatable UI strings |

### Code Formatting

C++ sources are formatted with clang-format 19.1.1 and CMake files with gersemi; CI checks
both on every changed file. Run them locally with `./build-aux/run-clang-format` and
`./build-aux/run-gersemi`.

## GitHub Actions & CI

GitHub Actions workflows are available for the following repository actions:

* `push`: Run for commits or tags pushed to `master` or `main` branches.
* `pr-pull`: Run when a Pull Request has been pushed or synchronized.
* `dispatch`: Run when triggered by the workflow dispatch in GitHub's user interface.
* `build-project`: Builds the actual project and is triggered by other workflows.
* `check-format`: Checks CMake and plugin source code formatting and is triggered by other workflows.

The workflows make use of GitHub repository actions (contained in `.github/actions`) and build scripts (contained in `.github/scripts`) which are not needed for local development, but might need to be adjusted if additional/different steps are required to build the plugin.

### Retrieving build artifacts

Successful builds on GitHub Actions will produce build artifacts that can be downloaded for testing. These artifacts are commonly simple archives and will not contain package installers or installation programs.

### Building a Release

To create a release, an appropriately named tag needs to be pushed to the `main`/`master` branch using semantic versioning (e.g., `12.3.4`, `23.4.5-beta2`). A draft release will be created on the associated repository with generated installer packages or installation programs attached as release artifacts.
